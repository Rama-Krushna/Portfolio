                                <h4>Introduction</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    English has become a language of vital importance in all sectors these days. India, a country with an astounding population of 135 Crores has only around 10.35% of it's population speaking English yet 43.63 % of the population are active Hindi with around more 6-7 % non-active Hindi speakers. But there exists a percentage of Indian population who do not know basic English as well. They only know vernacular language respective of thier region of stay. Being a language of vital importance a vast majority of the population should tend to know the language to a greater extent.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Problem</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    The problem statement was to design an app taking into consideration the percentage of Indians who knew any vernacular language but not English.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Solution</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    App was designed with proper reseach and ideation to generate better results and help the people learn English who do not know the language.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Design Process</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    Coming to the project, LearnEng is a mobile app design of a month-long solo project. I conducted the end-to-end research and design process, from conducting interviews to validating design decisions by testing with target users. My design evolved along with several rounds of iteration at different stages.

                                <h4>User Survey</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I conducted the user survey to gather data on some important information about the users to carry out the process. Some important insights that I gained included:<br>
                                    1. Majority of the people can spare 30 minutes to 1 hour for learning a new language.<br>
                                    2. Most of the people prefer a free course over a paid course.<br>
                                    3. Importance should be given to speaking abilities of the language.<br>
                                    4. Equal preference is given to learn using an available app and chosing an online course to learn a language.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Interview</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I conducted one-on-one interview with 3 different users: a student and 2 workers who faced the same problems in their daily life. I asked them a set of questions to identify their pain points. The insights gained from the interview were:
                                    1. Communicating with others in the language they were learning would help them more in learning the language.
                                    2. Inability to know the language creates problems in their everyday lives.
                                    3. It would be easier for them to learn if they are taught English using a language they are comfortable with. (A Odia speaking person finds it easier if someone teaches him English while explaing certain terms in Odia.)
                                </p>

                                <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I took a careful look at existing solutions within my context and analyzed their pros and cons with respect to supporting my target activity. I analyzed multiple existing language learning apps such as Babbel, DuoLingo, Utter and Bolo to explore insights. Moreover, I analyzed the comments of various language learning apps in the market, I took into consideration various other demands and suggestions that the users had given.

                                <h4>Target Audience</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    Analysing the insights gained from the reseach phase, I defined the target audience. The target audience comprised of the set of Hindi speaking/knowing people who knew any vernacular language respective of their region but do not know English or know just the basics of English. Taking into consideration, the time constraints and India, being a country with 20+ vernacular languages with a majority of them speaking Hindi, the people only speaking/knowing Hindi were selected. Therefore the finalized target audience was set of people who do not know English or know just the basics of English
                                </p>

                                <h4>User Personas</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I created Personas to represent a user group who face similar problems. This gave me a clear picture of the user's expectations and how they would like to use a product.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    After analysing the survey results, the user interview and the comments on similar available products, the following were the user pain points.

                                    Internet connection is required in order to access the app content.
                                    Lack of motivation. It does not encourage the user to do a task.
                                    Same course content is followed for all users irrespective of their expertise in the language.
                                    Absence of Hindi user interface for app.
                                    Absence of organised course content. Users have no idea of where to start and where to end.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Brainstorming and Feature Prioritization</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I brainstormed considering the user pain points and the target audience and then I enlisted out feasible features for the app that can eliminate or at least reduce the user pain point to greater extent. The features for are as follows:

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>User Flow</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I developed a generalized user flow for the user who will be using the app. The user flow comprised of one time onboard, sign up or login and then user would start a task(chapter/topic), get progress on his status and then get rewarded for completeion of the task(chapter).
                                </p>

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>Sitemap</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    After that I generated a sitemap demonstrating the navigation of content through the app.
                                </p>

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>Sketches</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    Before moving forward with the design, I drew rough sketches of each screen to get an overall view of how the app would look like.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    Having completed with the sketches, I designed low fidelity wireframes to get a quick review and feedback of the app before proceeding further in the process.
                                </p>

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>Visual Design Guidelines</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    The color and font was chosen in a manner to create a visual harmony in the deliverable user interface for the app.
                                </p>

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>High Fidelity Wireframes</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    After gathering feedback and suggestions from the low fidelity wireframe, I made certain design changes and applied the color schemes, typography and icons to it. The high fidelity wireframe, thus generated, I used it to create prototype of the app.
                                </p>

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>Prototypes</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    Using the high fidelity wireframe geenerated in previous step, I created a working prototype of the app to conduct user testing.
                                </p>

                                <img class="w-100" src="assets/img/blog/1.jpg" alt="">

                                <h4>Usability Reports</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    I conducted user testing & cognitive walkthroughs to find out usability issues in the interface of the app. Most of the users found the application user-friendly and could easily navigate between the screens. There were some problems in the Lesson topics where user found it difficult to change section from "Learn" to "Test" or "Discuss". I solved the situation by adding a tab to change section from "Learn" to "Test" or "Discuss" in the Lesson page itself.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Takeaways</h4>                                
                                <p>
                                    In this project, I was challenged to set aside my own assumptions and quarrels with the platform and seek feedback from all types of users. This project provided the opportunity for me to learn the value of user research techniques like surveys and interviews to gain a deeper understanding of all users. With users participating along my design process, I have gained more comprehensive understanding of different factors surrounding the problem to reduce my design bias.
